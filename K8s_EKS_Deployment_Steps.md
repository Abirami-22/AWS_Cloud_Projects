<h1>Amazon EKS</h1>

Elastic Kubernetes Service is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. It handles the Kubernetes control plane (also known as the master nodes) for you.
EKS can be considered the managed Kubernetes control plane / master node.

<h3>âœ… What EKS Manages (Control Plane): </h3>
When you create an EKS cluster, AWS provisions and manages the following control plane components:

1. API Server

2. etcd (key-value store)

3. Controller Manager

4. Scheduler

5. Cloud Integration for IAM, VPC, etc.

You donâ€™t manage or access the control plane servers directly â€” AWS handles high availability, security patches, and scaling of these components.

<h3>ðŸ”¸ What You Manage (Data Plane):</h3>

You (the user) manage:

1. Worker nodes (EC2, Fargate, or other compute backends)

2. Kubernetes workloads (pods, deployments, services, etc.)

3. Networking and storage configurations

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

**AWS Account:** You will be deploying resources to AWS, so you need an AWS account with sufficient permissions (Administrator or a role that can create EKS clusters, IAM roles, VPCs, etc.).

**AWS CLI:** Installed and configured with your AWS credentials. This lets you interact with AWS from the command line (e.g., to fetch cluster details or configure credentials).

**kubectl:** The Kubernetes CLI for interacting with the cluster. Ensure you have kubectl installed (matching your clusterâ€™s Kubernetes version) and on your PATH. You can install it via Amazonâ€™s instructions (for example, by downloading the binary from an S3 URL and making it executable).

**eksctl:** A CLI tool to create and manage EKS clusters easily. We'll use eksctl to create the Kubernetes cluster and to set up some addons. Install eksctl v**â‰¥0.148.0** (latest version) on your system.

**Helm:** The package manager for Kubernetes, used to deploy the applicationâ€™s Helm chart. Install Helm v3 on your system.

**Docker (optional):** If you want to test locally or build images, Docker is useful. (For this deployment, you wonâ€™t need to build images manually because pre-built images are available on Docker Hub.)
